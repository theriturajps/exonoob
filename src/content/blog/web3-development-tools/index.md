One of the most exciting technological developments at the moment is Web 3. And now is the ideal moment to learn and put your ideas into action if you want to ride this wave. There is a lot of labour going on here, and the best part is that it's the only industry that welcomes people from all backgrounds.

However, it might be really difficult to find excellent web3 dev tools to study and build.

To help you create amazing projects, I have compiled a collection of web3 developer tools.

## [Composio Crypto-Kit](https://composio.dev/ai-crypto-kit/)

Both AI and cryptocurrency are popular. Cryptocurrency and AI agents can work pretty well together. AI agents are able to efficiently communicate with decentralised apps, automate the management of cryptocurrency portfolios, and carry out complex DeFi techniques like yield optimisation and cross-chain arbitrage.

Numerous connections, including those with Solana, Opensea, Binance, Coinbase, Coin Gecko, and others, allow Crypto-Kit to link AI agents and automate processes. Additionally, you may create AI automation by utilising Composio interfaces with platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Gmail, and Discord.

Read the [documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/cryptokit/tools) for each of the Crypto-Kit tools.

## [Hardhat | The Most Well-Known Ethereum Innovation](https://hardhat.org/)

Hardhat is most likely the first place you should look if you're working on Ethereum. Imagine it as your development command centre, complete with a great testing environment, robust debugging tools, and a local blockchain for testing. It also has a lot of plugins to expand its capabilities and works well with TypeScript.

## [Anchor | The Standard Framework for Solana Development](https://www.anchor-lang.com/)

Constructing on Solana? Anchor has you covered. For Solana, it's similar to Hardhat, but it has a distinct flavour. The development process will go much more smoothly, you'll create less boilerplate code, and security checks will be integrated. The testing arrangement is beautiful; it's easy to mimic intricate program interactions.

## [Foundry | Lightning-Quick Ethereum Testing Structure](https://getfoundry.sh/)

The newest trend in Ethereum development is called Foundry. We're talking about tests that run up to 20 times faster than typical tools thanks to built-in Rust. You can write your tests in Solidity, which is the same language as your contracts, which is amazing. For optimisation, the gas snapshots feature is invaluable.

## [Modern Ethereum Library | Ethers.js](https://ethers.org/)

Consider Ethers.js to be your Ethereum interaction Swiss Army knife. For good reason, it has supplanted Web3.js as the preferred JavaScript library due to its robust TypeScript integration, clearer API, and improved wallet support. Ethers.js is useful whether you're creating a straightforward dApp or a sophisticated DeFi protocol.

## [Official Solana JavaScript SDK | Solana Web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)

The official JavaScript development kit for Solana. It manages everything you need, including transactions, account management, and communication with nodes. There are fewer runtime surprises thanks to TypeScript support and comprehensive documentation. It serves as the cornerstone of any Solana project.

## [Battle-Tested Smart Contract Library | OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/)

Do you want to create safe smart contracts? Your best friend is OpenZeppelin. They have security tools, a Defender suite for managing deployed contracts, and battle-tested implementations of all the main standards. Using code that has been audited numerous times is preferable to starting from scratch.

## [Browser-Based Solidity IDE | Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

Remix can be used when you need to rapidly test a concept or debug a contract. The entire Ethereum development environment, including the compiler and debugger, is available in your browser. Excellent for learning, prototyping, or, if you choose, full development.

## [Solana Playground | Solana IDE Web-Based](https://beta.solpg.io/)

For Solana, similar to Remix. Programs can be written, built, and launched directly from your browser. Testing is made easy by the instantaneous interaction with your deployed programs and the great real-time compilation feedback.

## [Personal Ethereum Blockchain | Ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

Do you require an Ethereum blockchain of your own? Ganache is that. It allows you to regulate everything, including block duration and gas constraints, making it ideal for testing. You can test how your code will work with current protocols by using the mainnet forking function.

## [Alchemy | Web3 Infrastructure of Enterprise Grade](https://www.alchemy.com/)

Blockchain infrastructure is advanced by alchemy. You receive powerful APIs, comprehensive statistics, and capabilities like WebSocket support in addition to simple node access. Their NFT API is very reliable for production installations and is amazing.

## [High-Performance Helius RPC in Solana](https://www.helius.dev/)

Rapid, dependable RPC access combined with specialised APIs that simplify complicated tasks. They have good WebSocket support, and their Digital Asset Standard implementation is very useful when working with NFTs.

## [The Blockchain Data Indexing Protocol | The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)

Before The Graph, it was difficult to query blockchain data. It enables you to use GraphQL to obtain the exact data you require at the appropriate time. No more clumsy REST APIs or intricate indexing solutions. Create your schema, index the information you require, and then start querying.

## [Tenderly | Platform for Monitoring Smart Contracts](https://tenderly.co/)

Are you curious about the precise status of your smart contracts? With its robust debugging tools, real-time monitoring, and transaction simulation capabilities, Tenderly is the solution. You may sleep better at night thanks to the alerting system and optimise your contracts with the help of the gas profiler.
