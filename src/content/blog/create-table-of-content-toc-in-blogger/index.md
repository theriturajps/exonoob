Sure you have, there are moments when one feels that they are literally drowning in text while going through lengthy blog posts. That's why the **Table of Contents (ToC)** is so useful! Imagine it as a kind of a plan, helping readers go through your masterfully written text.

As 2025 is still in sight, it says that having a ToC is no longer a mere luxury but an indispensable element if you are a Blogger user.
 
When you go for an automatic ToC, you are thus not just making the work easier for your readers. You are also enhancing the blog's search engine optimization, organization, and user engagement to the blog. It's a win-win situation!

## What is a ToC?

A **Table of Contents** is also as simple as what the term suggests, it is a list of some of the major divisions of your blog post. But an automatic ToC? That's the real magic. They generate themselves depending on the headings of your post and change in real time when you are writing.

## How it improves user experience

When you run an article, blog, website, social page, or blog post, what do you think would happen if you offered your readers their own tour guide to your content? That is the purpose of any ToC we create. It helps them to quickly move to areas which they deem relevant; hence, making your content easily digestible.

headlength = document.getElementById("post-toc").getElementsByTagName("h2").length;for (i = 0; i &lt; headlength; i++)           
{gethead = document.getElementById("post-toc").getElementsByTagName("h2")[i].textContent;document.getElementById("post-toc").getElementsByTagName("h2")[i].setAttribute("id", "point"+i);mbtTOC = "&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='#point"+i+"'&gt;"+gethead+"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;";document.getElementById("mbtTOC").innerHTML += mbtTOC;}}function mbtToggle() {var mbt = document.getElementById('mbtTOC');if (mbt .style.display === 'none') {mbt .style.display = 'block';} else {mbt .style.display = 'none';}}
